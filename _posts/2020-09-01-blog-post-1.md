Recently I am practicing plotly to create interactive plots. In this blogpost, I plot some data from Labor Force Survey.

The first figure I present here is that of employment rates in Japan, across age groups.

Next I present two figures that show how population and employment (level) in Japan have changed over time for male and female and for different age groups. In each subplot, population and employment are depicted, in blue and red, respectively, for a particular age group. Figures are drawn separately for male and female.



Female:

Male:
